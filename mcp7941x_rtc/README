The MCP79411 is an I2C RTC chip which also includes 1K of EEPROM,
64 bytes of SRAM and a Unique ID.

There are 3 flavours of the MCP7941x, which differ in the Unique ID content:
MCP79410 - Blank
MCP79411 - EUI-48 Mac Address
MCP79412 - EUI-64 Mac Address

The chip uses an I2C address of 0x57 for the EEPROM and 0x6f for the RTC and SRAM
(the Wire library takes care of adding a LSB for read/write selection)
